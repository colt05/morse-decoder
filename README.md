# morse-decoder

## Requirements
Python 3  
Keyboard Module  

## What it does
Morse key = q (by default, change the MorseKey variable to the hotkey you will use)   
After putting in a set of pulses, wait a bit. There is a timeout when the letter you input is finished. It won't be pushed into the buffer for a few seconds.  
Then, the console will be spammed with the list of letters you've typed. Input again at any time.
